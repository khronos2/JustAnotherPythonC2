# JustAnotherPythonC2
This repository is meant to serve as a place for my personal project of learning how C2's work in better detail and also providing me with something to use on engagements that I understand and can control.

This project is based off a small course on creating a Python C2, so some of the beginning code will be basic or incomplete until I progress further in the course.
